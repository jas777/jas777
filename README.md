### Projects worth mentioning
- **Sarano** - a Discord bot base written in Kotlin, just cause I wanna mess with it
- **Vexlo** - a Discord bot written in Rust, same reason as Sarano
- **Signalbox** - a Minecraft mod that adds train signals (mainly for Immersive Railroading), but that's on hold for some time
- **Many others** - I don't put everything on git, but I want to start doing that :)
- **Venom** - a Discord bot written in Java that has an extensive argument parsing system aswell as custom command handler
